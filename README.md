# Hawkes Process Analysis on BIT-USD and QQQ Indicators

## Overview

### Overview Description

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Hawkes process applied to the financial indicators BIT-USD and QQQ. The Hawkes process is a self-exciting point process used for modeling events with clustering properties, such as financial transactions and price jumps. The project is implemented in python, leveraging its powerful statistical capabilities for financial analysis.

## Objectives

### General Objectives

- **Understand the Behavior**: Analyze the clustering behavior of events in BIT-USD and QQQ to identify patterns and potential triggers.
- **Modeling with Hawkes Process**: Implement and evaluate the Hawkes process model in R to capture the dynamics of these financial indicators.
- **Simulations and Predictions**: Perform simulations to predict future price movements and volatility using the Hawkes process framework.
- **Visualization**: Utilize advanced visualization techniques to represent the intensity and event occurrences over time.

## Key Features

- **Data Acquisition**: Scripts for fetching historical data of BIT-USD and QQQ from reliable financial data sources.
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and preprocessing tools to ensure high-quality input for modeling.
- **Model Implementation**: Implementation of the Hawkes process using python.
- **Simulation Engine**: Engine for simulating future events based on the fitted Hawkes model, allowing for scenario analysis and strategy development.
- **Visualization Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards using `streamlit` and `plotly` for visualizing event intensities, predicted trends, and historical data comparison.
